- items is shop:
-> Groceries for the old man
-> Squirrel nuts
-> Rose Seeds

- Blind guy waiting on semaphore, you talk and agree to help him cross, he crosses and thanks you, 
in gratitude he shows you a pop-up of how to say "Thanks" in braille or hand-language or whatever.

- Assets: blind man walking across zebra, also the pop-up screen

- Assets: basic room tilemap + hallway with some doors

- One door you knock and get a convo about an old man who asks you to bring him some food from the nearby store
    - Assets: all happens in front of closed door in hallway

- One door you enter and a kid is doing homework and needs help, you can help him by answering some questions correctly and then he's done
    - Assets: basic room tilemap + kid sitting at desk and writing some homework

- Outside is the girl of your dreams who wants to plant roses outside the building but is unsure of the legality of it. You do it anyway.
- Assets: the monster-girl outside the flat and some empty/full rose-bush boxes in front of the building, and "seeds" item from the shop
- Also: the police officer should now be here and disaprove of this, as you are putting roses he should say "It's a nice thing but is it strictly legal?!" 
this is to influence the minds of young children to disobey authority (as our dark lord G.Soros commands)


- Similarly, a character should enter other "shops" there, more specifically 5 "volonteer" organisations: Roda, Dog Trainer Club, Animal Protection Club LUNJA, a watchdog organisation for monster rights and also a Parkoljupci park-loving organisation, and some Activists
    - Assets: exteriors for the organisations (just some pixelart logos), you entering the building and dialogue prompt (no interior imo)

- Lunja people need you to feed squirrels on trees -> get squirrelfood from shop and go to trees and feed them

- Dog Trainer Club needs you to take and walk their dog, also they first ask you some general dog training questions which I will write
    - Assets: you walking the dog around and bringing him back, the dog is on a leash (terapijski pas)

- Monster Without Borders - they just inform you of your rights as a monster citizen, some questions can be here.

- Activists - when you have the Parkoljupci quest, they wanna help with the park thing by making nice posters (transparenti), 
this can be a minigame where you can make some transparent

- Parkoljupci want to build cool new stuff in the park but for this you need to get everyone out to the park to demand this (that's why you're doing this) 
- once the first part of the game is done the kids will want a cooler park and the camera will pan to this place so you know to come here first 
and get your next quest - which in turn will be just helping everyone else and in turn getting them to the park
    - Assets: everyone we've seen so far should be also drawn as standing in the park for the end-game, some are holding some posters
- The end: after everyone arrives and protests, the mayor appears on a flying rug and says "Ok, here's a better park" and it poof happens
    - Assets: mayor on a flying rug, better park assets (swings, klick-klacks, whatever)
